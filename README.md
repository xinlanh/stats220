# stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- My degrees are in:
  1. Mathmatics
  2. Computer Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because it's useful in the field of data science.
- I am interested in learning about how to get *rich*.


A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is:
